here we can leave comments on our progress
problems that we are facing etc and just general comments

- Updating the GUI after button actions is not working correctly:
	The table will update after window resize, but goes blank otherwise
	The label to show Store Capital is not updating at all
	Need to work out correct process for refreshing GUI	

- The backend processes for inventory are working as expected:
	User can name the store and add and item list
	User can generate a manifest based on item quantities
	User can upload manifests to adjust inventory levels and store capital
	User can upload sales logs to adjust inventory and store capital
	
- To do:

	1. Move the first Generate Manifest to the intro screen. Main GUI used only for adding sales and receiving manifests
	
	2. Subsequent manifests should be generated when a sales log is uploaded, instead of button; lower stock levels, raise capital
	and then create new manifest based on updated inventory.
	
	3. Only one action on main GUI should be possible at a time. If user loads a sales log,
	then the sales log button should be deactivated until the manifest has been created.
	To prevent loading mulitple/same sales logs or manifests being loaded and causing incorrect inventory/capital values
	
	4. Trucks functionality:
	
		Currently, manifests only show items and amounts. There is no consideration of item temps or truck capacity etc
